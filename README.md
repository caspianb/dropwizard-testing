# dropwizard-testing

A unit / integration test framework build around [Dropwizard Testing](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/tree/release/4.0.x/dropwizard-testing).

Wraps [DropwizardAppExtension](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.dropwizard/dropwizard-testing/1.3.9/io/dropwizard/testing/junit5/DropwizardAppExtension.html) with jupiter
extensions allowing tests to more easily configure an integration test environment as well as mocking services running within that test application.

Improved README documentation incoming.
